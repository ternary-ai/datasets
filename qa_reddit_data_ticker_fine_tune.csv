""The Inflation Hedge from PepsiCo, Inc. is Overbought"" and this body ""# Why the company\'s valuation relies on the assumption that inflation eventually goes down.\\n\\nWhile most of the stock market entered into a bear territory in 2022, a subset, consumer goods and retail, kept and even increased their market cap. This has been true for $PEP as the company is still gaining market cap after its earnings report, and is now trading for close to $236 billion.\\n\\nLet’s put that into perspective.\\n\\nIt seems a bit excessive that a mature company is trading at a 33x PE ratio, and when conducting a full DCF model for the company it becomes even harder to justify.\\n\\n*Here is a generally optimistic forecast model for PepsiCo:*\\n\\n[PEP Future Estimates Model 09.Feb.2023](https://preview.redd.it/gaf22uakl6ha1.png?width=1208&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7c53da6e946c5e2354cf525fb02fbf59dad76fd0)\\n\\nThis implies a revenue growth of 6% in the next 5 years, then converging to 3.5%. An improvement in operating margins to 15%, and efficient cash flow conversion, close the operating profits.\\n\\n*Note the projections below:*\\n\\n[PEP Valuation Table 09.Feb.2023](https://preview.redd.it/7jk7594nl6ha1.png?width=1163&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=57bfdc58714fd36981bdece016319a81b41af83b)\\n\\nThe result is a company that makes $150 billion in revenue, $22.5 billion in operating profit, and close to $16 billion in free cash flows to the firm.\\n\\nEven with these estimates, the intrinsic value of the company comes out to about $120 billion.\\n\\nYou will notice that the large sales to capital implies minor reinvestment in the company, which is consistent with the inflation backed revenue growth rate of 6%.\\n\\n[PEP Estimated Intrinsic Value at $120b. 09.Feb.2023](https://preview.redd.it/esip0mgpl6ha1.png?width=1208&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9c1491349fea464a7a5ac0d070fdf150f11a715e)\\n\\nIt seems that the company was close to fairly valued around 2020. However, as inflation kicked-in, PepsiCo slowly started losing value while posting top line growth. This value degradation comes from the increased cost of capital from around 6% to around 10% today.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nInvestors have flocked to $PEP and similar consumer goods &amp; retail companies in an effort to offset inflation. While this has worked with revenues, the market is now demanding higher returns from companies.\\n\\nThis can turn into a negative catalyst investors accept that rates are not coming down soon, and the market factors-in the increased cost of capital. On the other hand, the market may be (and usually is) right, and we can see a drop in rates which would justify current valuations.\\n\\nYou can copy and tweak the model [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1NiBvTWUSiHl3o0kwkAetBjd0uiUVZhY0YFbrNXYwh5I/copy).\\n\\nEdit: removed self promotion, replaced with spreadsheet.""', 'answer': '\nAre follow up questions needed here: No.\nThe final answer is: PEP\n'}",2023-02

""AMC Iron Condor \\""risk free\\"" arbitrage"" and this body ""There is an interesting situation with AMC at the moment. The company has preferred stock \\""APE\\"" trading at $1.50 and its common stock \\""AMC\\"" trading at $5.38\\n\\nShareholders have voted to allow the preferred to be converted into common at (roughly) a 1:1 basis, very soon, though there are legal hurdles to be overcome.\\n\\nNevertheless there are many investors who have bought APE, and shorted AMC, to try to profit from the convergence of the two.\\n\\nWhile this ordinarily would seem a sensible trade, there has been so much demand for AMC to be borrowed, that its borrow rate has shot up to around 800% per annum, causing these traders to hemorrhage cash the longer they hold the position.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe effect of this is that the price of PUT options has risen very substantially, because of demand from investors for an alternative near-short on the stock, and an arbitrage effect.\\n\\nSo much so, in fact, that there now appears to be an arbitrage opportunity using an \\""Iron Condor\\"" strike price CALL spread and PUT spread, for medium-term option expires, because the differences between the option prices between strike prices were greater than the difference in the strike prices themselves.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo I thought I\'d put the trade on today to see if it works, with just a small amount of money.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt is the June 16th 2023 expiry, and around 3 hours ago with the stock price at $5.27, the bid/offer spreads on Interactive Brokers showed the following prices for the $2 and $9 strike prices CALLS and PUTS:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nCALL $2 is 2.40-3.35\\tPUT $2 is  0.25-0.30\\n\\nCALL $9 is 0.27-0.37\\tPUT $9 is  5.70-6.20\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThese are very wide spreads, so I decided to put orders for contracts size 5 on the order book. Note I have around $80K in net liquidity, so this was a small position (size 5 contracts correspond to around $3000 of underlying at the moment).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThree hours passed, and the two buy-orders had filled, but the two sell orders had not.\\n\\nSo to save time I edited the two sell orders to the other side of the spread so that they filled.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo I have completed the following trades:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBought $2 PUT  for $0.26\\n\\nSold   $9 PUT  for $5.80\\n\\nBought $9 CALL for $0.27\\n\\nSold   $2 CALL for $3.33\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThese generate a net premium of $5.80 + $3.33 - $0.26 - $0.27 = $8.60\\n\\nOn 16th June, whatever the share price ends at, as the appropriate options are exercised, this will cost the difference in the strike prices, $9-$2 = $7.\\n\\nSo leaving a profit of $8.60 - $7 = $1.60 (minus trading costs).\\n\\nThe margin requirement for this is, I think, 2\\\\*$7=$14.\\n\\nSo the profit as a percentage of this margin is $1.60\\\\*100/$14 = 11.4%\\n\\nJune 16th is 66 days away. So the annualised return on investment this represents, is 11.4%\\\\*365/66 = 63%\\n\\nwhich on the face of it is not a bad return for a \\""risk free\\"" investment.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n(in my case for the 5 contracts I purchased on each leg, this generates a profit of 500\\\\*$1.60=$800 with commission so far totals $14.07\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHowever there is a problem, which is why I put \\""risk free\\"" in quotes. The $2 CALL I wrote is always at risk of being assigned early - which creates problems.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe reason for this is that the large spread between PUT and CALL prices, which is caused by the high stock borrow interest rate, causes the CALL prices to be pushed down compared with where they would normally be.\\n\\nBut the CALLS can only be pushed down so far. For in-the-money CALL options (which my $2 CALL is), once the price drops below the difference between the stock price and the strike price, it allows traders to make a risk-free profit by buying the cheap call, executing it early to buy the stock, then selling the stock. And this is the case even when there would normally be a time premium on the price of the option.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nNow if my $2 CALL is executed, then in theory it is not a problem because I can then just buy the corresponding amount of AMC stock and sell again a new $2 CALL option (which theoretically should put me in almost the same position, at the margin, as I was in before it was executed). But this takes time, temporary additional margin, and incurs extra trading costs.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhat I don\'t know, is how much, how often, this will happen. In the specific example of AMC at the moment, how long are in-the-money CALL options getting assigned early? If it is an efficient market then it shouldn\'t happen at all, I wouldn\'t have thought, because traders would bid up the value of CALLs when they are approaching the arbitrage limit. But I might be wrong about that.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIf I choose not to try to reinstate the $2 short call, then I will be holding onto a short position in the underlying - and paying 800% interest on it. So to prevent that I could instead use external cash to buy the stock to eliminate the short position. But this unbalances the arbitrage, leading to a positional loss if the share price reduces - which it has every chance of doing over the next few weeks if the company is successful at getting approval for the conversion of APE into AMC - which would reduce the AMC share price and raise the APE share price to a meeting somewhere in the middle probably.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThere is another potential problem. Which is that with such a large short position there is a possibility of a quite violent short squeeze. Indeed many of the long-term holders are hoping for this to happen- the \\""MOASS\\"" - Mother of all short squeezes.\\n\\nNow if this happens at the same time as my $2 CALL is exercised, then my account should in theory remain unchanged in value, as the negative effect of the short AMC reduces its value, but the positive effect of the rise in the value of the $9 CALL I own starts to provide credit. And indeed if the stock price goes above $9 then I could, if I needed to, execute that $9 CALL to eliminate the problem.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBut in a fast moving market I feel there is a risk that Interactive Brokers might not properly calculate margins correctly, and might choose to liquidate positions directly despite this. Which is why I\'m only trying this with plenty of excess margin (over $80K), which should cater for the price going well above its all time highs in around $50 I think it was.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt will be interesting to see what happens over the next 66 days, and see if my $800 profit can actually be realised. Or whether it gets eaten up by spreads and trading costs in a vain attempt to keep in place the $2 short call - and then I lose a load when the share price dives.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOptions are rather elegant, and interesting I think :)""', 'answer': '\nAre follow up questions needed here: No.\nThe final answer is: AMC\n'}",2023-04

I can not still fathom how underwhelming the vix reaction was today to CPI. The average move has been about 13% by the vix from low to peak and today we barely saw 10.8%. The VIX is not reacting normally at all and I believe this is what is propping markets up right now. The volatility is not there at all. Until the VIX kicks in a move there is no long positions worth playing at all. \\n\\nJanuary 12th- vix moved 7.6% total, February 10th- vix moved 22.8% total, March 10th- vix moved 12.6% total , April 12th- vix moved 13.9% , May 11th- vix moved 12% , June 10th- Vix moved 12.7%, July 13th- vix moved 10.8% total… very underwhelming… VIX didn’t even break 30 today…  \\n \\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uj7xvc41geb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=037cc80d706fea5b289c0d63136d665190bb418a\\n\\nThe Daily chart is starting to form some obvious trends the only issue is its hard to trust… you can see we have a nice inverse head and shoulders forming that should take us to 370 minimum and possible 365 at the lows. However, after todays bullshit its hard to trust and be able to go long for this. \\n\\nTodays open and close did show us a few things though. We rejected the daily 8ema again (bearish), we closed under yesterdays low (bearish), we gapped filled (neutral) and we bounced off 375 (bullish). \\n\\nRight now I am seeing 375 as support and 382 as resistance. Until one of these two levels are broken we aren’t gonna see the big move. \\n\\nBull case- 375 was higher low bottom today and we will break out back above 380 tomorrow and close over the daily 8ema breaking the red dotted resistance line and look for 400+ by end of month. For this case to play out markets have to price in 100bps hike over night (or have done it EOD today), fomc has to be beautifully executed and earnings have to be positive af… if we get all that there is a case to be made that bottom is in.\\n\\nBear case- today was the worlds biggest bull trap. There is historical accuracy that spy is one day late to react. Today I think is that day. Bears already blased through the black dotted support line and closed under it we will now be looking to complete the inverse head and shoulder and close closer to 370 EOD tomorrow and look for 365 EOD Friday. This would complete the inverse head and shoulders. From here this would be the 2nd test of the weekly 200ema at 363 and could finally break us through it. \\n\\nNeutral case- we are going to fuck around and find out what JPOW wants to say and do end of July at FOMC. We are stuck in this purple 370 to 390 sideways channel. This is where we are going to maintain for quite a while until we get some sort of amazingly bearish or terribly bearish catalyst. \\n\\n10% challenge-\\n\\nWeird day today… so I alerted yesterday that overnight puts were the play… I, however, decided it wasn’t worth gambling 30 and 50% profits overnight on a 50/50 win. I didn’t carry anything but my UVXY calls over night… they opened around 40% but when I saw VIX wasn’t gonna get on board yet again I closed them from 27.8%. Which is sad cause that is about what I should have closed them for yesterday before market closed…. In general I think next Cpi 2 days before playing 7dte ATM uvxy calls would still be the play assuming vix is near 25 again.\\n\\nFrom there I played the probability and got burnt… I watch the IV probable highs and lows and its resistance/ support that I rarely see broken. I did not anticipate that we had the strength to break through it and knowing that almost every CPI had closed lower than it opened I played some puts on the 10am rejection there and saw a quick 20% only to get absolutely wacked faster than I could get out of them. I attempted to average down once at 1115 when it looked like we topped and got wrecked. Overall I closed them for a pretty massive loss at 145pm only for it to dump next candle. That dump woulda saved me 20% loss. But I don’t know if I woulda closed either… \\n\\nI was patient EOD waiting for the sell off and scalped a nice full remaining BP 50% 0dte put scalp. Woulda been 150% had I held but wasn’t worth the risk.. I set a 50% stop limit when I saw 60% profits and wasn’t gonna gamble… it didn’t give me a green day… but it did give me a green week still. \\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d7kvgs52geb91.png?width=650&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a43f1f28f9ea3fdd1ff6f32f747fbc243e783e7\\n\\nOvernight I am holding these… I am going with the bull trap narrative and that the next 100 bps is gonna get priced in today and tomorrow. \\n\\nMy break even is 371.75 (-1.8%) for tomorrow and 366.5 for Friday (-3.6% ) from todays closed… I think we get that 370 test tomorrow and that its worth the risk.. if the VIX ever gets back on board this should also get a nice IV pump on a bigger drop too. (see below) but 5 out of 6 post CPI days have also been red with 4 of those being significantly red (with the average being -2%). However, I did not recommend NEW overnight puts as almost all of those days as you can see below did not open with any significant pre market drop. \\n\\nBiggest lesson today for me was you may be right but your timing may be wrong. In the end being patient and waiting for my play instead of anticipating the play is always best. Had I waited at 10am for a confirmed breakdown in theory there should have been enough left for plenty of gains. However, that doji at 1015am was highly unexpected and did come out of nowhere and all things pointed to heavy bear at the time. In the end the less here is that we CAN NOT ever make a trade that will blow our accounts up. One single trade should NEVER be enough to end your trading career. If it is you went to heavy. I recommend 5-10% per trade. That means that if you have 10k in your options account (again not full net worth) that you only trade $500-$1000/ position. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/owmjhxs2geb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18b4c43471e7a621a27ffb701f70417f8c2311f1""', 'answer': '\nAre follow up questions needed here: No.\nThe final answer is: SPY\n'}",2022-07

I think $PLTR is going to go down, and I also have the feeling CPI is going to add downward pressure too. \\n\\n(Concessions: I don’t follow PLTR closely and my feeling on CPI is from overall sentiment.)\\n\\nConsiderations:\\n\\nI am wanting to practice a more buying-focused strategy. I’ve had a higher *quantity* of selling wins and most of my losses by dollar amount have been on the buying side. \\n\\nIdeas:\\n\\nAny trade I’d likely buy Monday, probably AM, and try to sell Tuesday but might shift based on how Tuesday goes. Looking at 2/17 expiration. I’m sure IV will hit to an extent and probably should have bought in this past week and maybe could have even closed on Monday if IV rose enough. \\n\\n1) buy a put near-the-money or ATM. \\n\\n2) buy a straddle:\\n     Looking at a slightly bearish straddle. Since movement projected is wide, a straddle seems like a smart play. The bullish protection would at least reduce loss if I am wrong. I know my risk is also if the underlying *doesn’t* move as wide. I think picking a slightly bearish strike would help me if I’m right on direction and wrong on degree of movement. \\n\\nSince I don’t know $PLTR super well, I’m also considering just picking an ATM straddle which would then limit risk to degree of movement. I’ve also thought about augmenting an ATM straddle with also buying a slightly OTM put to tilt towards bearishness. I think I’ve been burnt enough to know I’m not great at predicting a direction when buying so far, so ATM and a second, cheap put could pick up a little more and for cheap. \\n\\nI thought if I sold multiple straddles ATM, I could also just buy a few OTM puts as well (e.g. buy 5 straddles, buy 3 OTM puts), but I think for this trade I’m just going to set up for 1. \\n\\nI also decided against a strangle since the predicted move is wide and being a meme-ish stock in the current environment I think it will move big, and a strangle just doesn’t seem profitable enough.

""How to play tonight\'s AAPL Earnings safely"" and this body ""Apple (AAPL), the king of the stock market, reports earnings is scheduled to report fiscal second-quarter results after close today. Apple stock has not disappointed this year and the sturdiness of Apple’s returns simply cannot be understated. The stock is up 30% YTD, 300% over the last five years, and **1100% over the last 10 years**. It isn’t flawless though, as it was down -30% during 2022. However, it has nearly earned it all back in the first four months of 2023. \\n\\nAs the world’s leading consumer products and technology company, Apple’s earnings act as an important forerunner for the broader economy. What should we expect from Tim Apple? \\n\\nHere’s what analysts think:\\n\\n* Earnings: $1.43 per share, according to [Refinitiv](https://www.refinitiv.com/)\\n\\n* Revenue: $92.96 billion, according to Refinitiv\\n\\nRevenue is expected to *decrease* 4.4% from $97.28 billion in the same quarter a year ago. This isn’t great, but also not terrible. Something I don’t often see mentioned about Apple is the strong seasonal tendencies of its revenues. [Take note of this chart.](https://i.imgur.com/3JGDWtt.png). In the quarterly revenues, we see revenues regularly explode higher following the holiday season and are then mostly stagnant through the rest of the year. But Q1 2023 sales were below Q1 2022, which shows that there was a YoY slowdown in the most recent holiday season.\\n\\nApple prepared investors for a down quarter in January. The company hasn’t provided formal guidance since 2020, but it gives analysts and investors a number of data points that can be used to roughly estimate its performance.\\n\\nThe information it provided earlier this year suggested that sales would drop for a second straight quarter by roughly 5%. Sales of iPads and Macs are expected to see sharp decreases — 12% and 25.4%, respectively — and iPhone sales also likely dropped. Analysts polled by [FactSet](https://www.factset.com/) expect annual declines in all of Apple’s hardware product lines.\\n\\nThe report comes as the PC and smartphone markets are mired in one of the worst slumps in recent years. Electronics sales are down sharply after many consumers bought new PCs and phones during the pandemic and others are tightening their belts because of high inflation or recession worries.\\n\\nIn the first quarter, PC shipments decreased 29%, [according to IDC](https://siliconangle.com/2023/04/10/idc-worldwide-pc-shipments-fell-29-first-quarter/), while smartphone shipments were off 14%.\\n\\nApple’s report wraps up earnings season for tech’s mega-cap companies, after Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft all issued results last week. All four topped analyst estimates, though growth rates were still muted compared to prior years.\\n\\nWhile Apple isn’t immune to the broader market slowdown, some analysts hope it will show strength and resiliency because it sells premium products and has loyal customers. Refinitiv consensus estimates suggest Apple could guide back to growth. They expect 2% expansion in the third quarter. But others are concerned that revenue will keep falling, suggesting that demand for Apple’s products is eroding.\\n\\nDoes anyone know Samik Chatterjee, the analyst at JPMorgan? He mentioned in a note this week that the \\""eventual outcome might be simply driven by F3Q guidance, where investors might be looking for assurance and visibility into limited downside despite a tough macro.” See, if Apple’s outlook suggests a year-over-year decline that’s less than 5%, Apple could still “triumph” on fundamentals, at least according to Chatterjee.\\n\\nAlong with earnings, Apple is also likely to update investors on its [capital return authorization](https://fortune.com/2023/04/17/how-much-will-apple-spend-on-stock-buybacks-earnings-90-billion/). Analysts expect the iPhone maker to announce plans to spend as much as $90 billion on share repurchases and dividends.\\n\\n**What about the Technicals?**\\n\\nThere isn’t a clean chart pattern to trade AAPL from, [but this large range looks significant](https://i.imgur.com/xcIhkg0.png). The $180 level is resistance and $130 support. Right now, price is in no-mans land in the middle of this large range.\\n\\nIf price can clear the $180 level, resistance should turn into support, and the next multi-year leg higher in Apple should commence. However, a rejection at $180 would be very significant. If the stock can’t clear that level, it may be indicative of not just Apple, but the market more broadly.\\n\\nWith a recession likely coming later this year, it is possible we will see Apple retest the high of the range, and then as the recession takes hold, swing back down to the bottom of the range. Rather than trying to short the stock, investors would be better off waiting for price to come back down to the $130-$140 buy zone.\\n\\n**Valuation??**\\n\\nThe price of Apple is currently 28 times its one-year forward profits, which is higher than both the market average and its five-year median price of 24 times. Despite being one of the most respected companies in the world, this valuation is neither particularly high nor low. The bears don\'t have a good time with this fair assessment.\\n\\n**What to do for Earnings?**\\n\\nApple is a juggernaut in the stock market, and its supremacy is undeniable. Apple brought luxury to the masses, so if the average person begins to feel the heat of a slowing economy, they probably won’t be buying a new iPhone. Does this mean puts for earnings? We know the stock moves on average 5 ± 3% with earnings. However last quarter, it moved +7%, the one before it was +9% and the one before it was +6%. Wait, so calls? I\'m thinking a strangle. I\'m going to bet that while it moves on average 5%, it\'s going to move more, without attempting to predict whether it\'s going up or down. So I\'ll be buying AAPL 5/5 160p (at 138 bucks) and 170c (at 150 bucks). This means you can get the strangle for $288. The stock would have to move 4.6% up or 5.1% down to break even. Mind you, this post is not financial or investment advice - consider it as just me offering some education based on what analysts tend to look for in a company when it\'s time to make a last minute earnings prediction. In fact, just because I\'m posting it, AAPL might just stay flat.""', 'answer': '\nAre follow up questions needed here: No.\nThe final answer is: AAPL\n'}",2023-05

A potential alternative outcome would be if First Republic sells assets to the 11 banks that provided it with $30 billion last month in more of an industry solution to backstop its balance sheet.""', 'answer': '\nAre follow up questions needed here: No.\nThe final answer is: FRC\n'}",2023-04

We cover this case in detail in the article \\""[https://www.brightworkresearch.com/saphana/2019/06/03/what-was-the-real-story-with-the-revlon-s-4hana-failure/](https://www.brightworkresearch.com/saphana/2019/06/03/what-was-the-real-story-with-the-revlon-s-4hana-failure/) What Was the Real Story with the Revlon S/4HANA Failure?  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Revlon attributed to the changeover a reduction of $20M in net earnings in one quarter alone, accompanied by $10M in unplanned expenses including non-recurring labor to improve customer support. At the time (2018), Revlon had implemented SAP in 22 countries on the Revlon heritage side of the company. Apparently, the Arden switch-out of JD Edwards had not even begun at that stage. A year later, in March 2019, CFO Victoria Dolan said Revlon had spent $32M in 2018 on operating activities in comparison to 2017, taking the costs of the migration to $54M; understandably, profits and stock prices dipped. Revlon reported increased losses....  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;**Ironically the results were due to a drop in sales of all its business categories, except Elizabeth Arden, partly caused by the breaks in service levels directly attributed to the SAP implementation...**\\n\\nLawsuit #10 covers Waste Management:\\n\\n&gt;Did SAP deceive and defraud Waste Management (WM) during ERP selection and implementation? That’s the question at stake in a $500 million lawsuit against SAP relating to a Waste Management ERP failure.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;According to documents filed in court by WM, SAP pitched WM on a well-tested, sector-specific, ready-to-install ERP package. **WM learned after the implementation had started that no such software existed.** Rather, the ERP system in question was still in development and had “never been tested in a productive environment.”...\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rs9im4a3ak8b1.png?width=2346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=68aa46c70e613d0e877da55978dafef9e8ba1a2c\\n\\n&gt;WM’s fraud allegations go much deeper than simple misrepresentation. Before contracts were signed, SAP purportedly demonstrated the fully functioning software to WM. **WM claims it relied on SAP’s demonstrations when it chose the SAP software. WM says that SAP demonstrated a “mock-up” version and that the demonstrations “were rigged and manipulated to depict false functionality.”**  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;SAP denies the allegations.**However, if WM wins on its fraud and misrepresentation claims, this case could drive a stake through the heart of the world’s leading ERP vendor. No customer will want to build its business operations on a foundation of lies and deception. In addition, SAP will likely face criminal investigations. Members of SAP’s C-Suite were directly involved in landing the WM account. Some of those executives are no longer with the company.** There’s plenty of speculation about whether their departures are related to the WM fiasco.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOf course, it\'s justifiable to play devil\'s advocate. SAP **IS** used by tons of firms, and there have been other entities featured in the complaints where they admit it was hard for people to learn the system in the first place, or dealing with a switchover was tough etc. Cases like the WM one are harder to wave, esp if you show a fake version of something that DOES NOT EXIST OR DO WHAT IT\'S MEANT TO DO.\\n\\nAnd hell, if SAP services (hehe) so many companies, statistically it\'s impossible for some to not implement correctly. Sure, why not...\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d04zv2v7bk8b1.png?width=2788&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c7be0a9df53905d18ebd5a4a5b0fbf07b4c83c8a\\n\\nSo even considering that counterpoint, and avoiding the BCG discussion (let\'s assume they are saints lol) and that BCG Platinion has never had any ulterior motives.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wnkva4epbk8b1.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=60677103615e7267c8bb23d1b011f8e1db9a5a86\\n\\nLet\'s somehow suspend disbelief and say that\'s true.\\n\\nAnd let\'s somehow say that all of the SAP lawsuits are completely meritless and they have also been nothing but saints. So in this scenario it is an ULTIMATE devil\'s advocate argument, where SAP (&amp; BCG affiliated runs with SAP via Platinion) are complete saints, help old ladies cross the street, donate their Patagonia vests to the homeless, and spend Friday night at the soup kitchens.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n[100&amp;#37; this is what I think of when I think of BCG employees btw](https://preview.redd.it/pqc99lxvck8b1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=faf3656936ce3a3ea7ffffc96de583fdb971eee4)\\n\\nSo let\'s argue that. But EVEN THEN, I think you can still make a case for how a bad or slow SAP implementation in parts can not only be found out (especially when dealing with a company you want to short), but worked through backwards in part through something I covered in 2 recent posts of my \\""Big Mall Short\\"" series: #9 (Check.

A company announces a new SAP ERP implementation. Or maybe from quarter-to-quarter, there is a major change in operating costs seen (as seen in the Revlon shareholders case) where there is the idea that a migration from system A to system B is taking place.\\n2. Firms like Advan Research, where 95% of its clients are hedge funds, are feeding truck data about shipments to their hedge fund clients, who check to see if the 2 AM nightly truck shipment of goods arrives to the company that announced the new SAP ERP implementation.\\n3. Advan data shows that the truck is now arriving no longer at 2 AM, and for months after is arriving several hours later. (This is something that no one would know other than the truck driver perhaps, the store workers, because hey stock shareholders aren\'t outside with binoculars at 2 AM).\\n4. Hedge fund catches wind and infers that the SAP ERP implementation isn\'t going smoothly and decides LET\'S SHORT THE COMPANY.\\n\\nSee? No cOnsPirAcY needed **and you can STILL PROVE THE POINT.**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMeaning even if I don\'t have access to THIS via some in to a company\'s SAP ERP data:\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d0lbo01bik8b1.png?width=2470&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=60a5dffcef92289da3eaf48850fa436a7ab03ecd\\n\\n**I can still backtrack a fair amount of things that go wrong enough for a hedge fund fielding data from firms like Advan to short a company.

Will the Company be profitable?**\\r  \\n\\r  \\nCFO: As we\'ve stated previously, we\'re still on track to achieve GAAP profitability this quarter and expect to maintain GAAP profitability going forward.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nWe\'re going to generate $300 million to $500 million of tangible book value in 2024 (Every $100 million of incremental growth in tangible book value results in $800 million of organic lending capacity ward.)\\r  \\n\\r  \\nCEO: our goal of achieving positive GAAP net income in the fourth quarter is one that we remain very confident in.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nOur goal is to maintain positive GAAP net income in each year after 2023.\\r  \\n\\r  \\n**2. Do you plan to deliver dividends to shareholders in the future?**\\r  \\n\\r  \\nCFO: So, it\'s certainly something we\'ll consider as it becomes relevant to us\\r  \\n\\r  \\n**3. Christopher H. When you acquired Technisys guided for $85 million to $100 million in savings between 2023 and 2025. Can you give an update on how that\'s progressing and when we can expect to see products like trucking and savings and credit card using Cyberbank Core?**\\r  \\n\\r  \\nCFO: we\'ve made really good progress and are on track to hit the $85 million to $100 million in cost savings we guided to at the time of acquisition. As we\'ve now fully integrated the business and have a robust go-to-market joint product offering strategy.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nCEO: We continue to actively explore ways to leverage the technology platform at SoFi and also to leverage the technology platform resources to develop products and services more broadly for the industry.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nOne product that SoFi is already using is called Konecta. It\'s a natural language tap box for customer service. It\'s helped reduce our costs overall and serving our members from a direct access standpoint and a health standpoint.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nSoFi buy-now, pay-later product was the first product that was built on SoFi-Galileo from a processing standpoint as well as Technisys core.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nfrom Technisys, a product called payment risk platform that allows the data and the algorithms at the tech platform, which experiences about 8 billion transactions a year to provide for better fraud protection on an authorization basis per transaction, and that\'s something that we\'ll continue to invest quite aggressively in.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nlarge opportunity to have technology platform, take the lead in developing products and services that SoFi needs and the rest of the industry uses. That shows up in less cost from the EPD engineering part of the design standpoint at SoFi Money as well as some of our lending products.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nwe bought two companies that have vast engineering capabilities, we\'ve been able to drive some synergies but bring them together, both on the tech side as well as the go-to-market side. And you see that manifest itself in higher margins at the tech platform business, which has been increasing quite meaningfully, and we\'ll continue to do so throughout the year.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nThe biggest opportunities for us will show up as more revenue and more profit in the tech platform and that will be the conversion from our core banking technology platform that we use today at SoFi to a Technisys platform\\r  \\n\\r  \\n**4. Why should shareholders be confident in holding long term?**\\r  \\n\\r  \\nCEO: we believe we\'re the best positioned to be the winner take most.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nTwo years later, I couldn\'t be more confident in that vision and strategy and mission and our execution since then.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nif we can do all of those things in a unique way for them in a personalized way, then they can get their money right and realize their versions. That means we have to be a one-stop shop.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nbusiness that\'s hard to make money in, in downturns like we\'ve seen with high interest rates in that market today. And it\'s very easy to make money when rates are very low (something to look forward to in the next several years)\\r  \\n\\r  \\nwe want to help them borrow better, save better, spend better, invest better and protect better.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nTo date, we\'re the only company that I\'m aware of digital that\'s offering products across those five verbs that I laid out, and we\'ve executed successfully. The second important point about the Company is our competitive advantage. We draw a competitive advantage from the fact that we are a one-stop shop and when we drive success in one product and drive trust and reliability in that product, that member takes a second or a third product from us.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nallows us to get better rates as it relates to things like SoFi Money, lower interest rates on things like loans and more products and services like our free certified financial planner and all the content that we produce.\\r  \\n\\r  \\none-stop shop does provide us with that higher lifetime value. But importantly, we want each of our products to be best of breed from a consumer value proposition standpoint.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAnd the combination of those things allows us to operate at lower cost and higher LTV, which is the sustainable competitive advantage.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nit\'s about becoming a household brand name that is known by everyone when they think about who to using the financial services industry. And that, in total, allow us to be the winner that takes most in the financial services sector as it relates to technology delivery services.\\r  \\n\\r  \\n**5. Where do you see the Company in 2025?**\\r  \\n\\r  \\nCEO: We do believe that over time, you\'ll see our business be third borrowing, a third technology platform revenue, and a third financial services revenue.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nIt\'s likely that in 2024, 50% of our revenue will come from borrowing and 50% of our revenue will come from the technology platform and financial services combined.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nBy 2025, our hope is that we\'re adding close to $1 million, if not more than $1 million per quarter in new members versus what we\'ve averaged in the $400,000 range throughout 2023.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nyou\'ll continue to see us go deeper and broader in the product categories we are today.\\r  \\n\\r  \\n**6. what is SoFi doing to expand? Is there a plan to buy companies in the sector or to expand internationally?**\\r  \\n\\r  \\nCEO: our focus is really about continuing to make our products more scalable to continue to make them safe to continue to drive brand awareness and to continue to build out the selection within those products.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI know that there\'s a high demand for Level 1 options. We also know there\'s a huge opportunity to offer retail investors, Main Street investors, alternative asset classes like private equity funds and hedge funds and credit funds and real estate investment funds.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nwe\'ve delivered IPOs and fractional shares to Main Street investors before anyone else. And so we have a huge opportunity within each one of the verbs that I mentioned to continue to expand.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nExpedia online travel purchases and helping people their travel products\\r  \\n\\r  \\nWe\'re trying to offer that product at a better way to buy.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAnd so in each one of those verbs will continue to build out, so no need for us to go out and buy anything big or small. We\'ve got all the products that we believe we need to be successful. (implies no new expenditure for the near term)\\r  \\n\\r  \\n**7. What will set SoFi apart from all the other fintech companies going forward to ensure your investors are in the right company?**\\r  \\n\\r  \\nCEO: I think we\'re at the point now where the leaders are emerging, but they\'ll start to reach escape velocity over the next two years.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI do believe over the next two or three years, you\'ll see the winners that are sitting on top of each vertical category today move further and further away from their other fintech competitors and further and further away from the incumbents.\\r  \\n\\r  \\n**8. Where do you see fintech in the next five years? And how will SoFi contribute to the developing technology?**\\r  \\n\\r  \\nCEO: We are just starting to see the technologies emerge within the Fintech sector that are needed for digital transactions that are needed for digital experiences. If you think about fraud, many of the large banks in our country are using a technique to stop fraud on digital by simply not allowing people to open up accounts.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nSoFi is only a technology company. We don\'t have physical locations.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nYou can only open an account through our app or our website, and we\'ve developed technologies to ensure we prevent fraud on activity from account takeover and also new account fraud. We also do that on transactions.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nboth transactional fraud and account opening fraud is going to grow by magnitude because it\'s the one product that if you get right, it saves you money instantly. And so the ROE on it is very high.\\r  \\n\\r  \\n**9. what is the biggest challenge that you foresee SoFi facing in the coming quarter? What is your strategy as an executive team to overcome the said challenge?**\\r  \\n\\r  \\nCEO: I would focus more over the next 12 months.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nOur business has shown an ability to do well in high rate environments and do well in lower rate environments.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nthe amount of motivated people to steal money to interact with the frontal service industry to benefit only increases (Thus, the benefits of being all digital)\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAnd then, of course, we\'re focused on our balance sheet and making sure we have proper liquidity, proper capital, and that we continue to maintain a very strict credit standards.\\r  \\n\\r  \\n**10. how is SoFi to survive the possible upcoming recession?**\\r  \\n\\r  \\nCFO: I\'ll reiterate. So our business has shown the ability to perform in different rate and macro environments.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nwe\'re on track to reach GAAP profitability in this quarter, which helps greatly with tangible book value generation, and it provides us with much more flexibility in investing for growth.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nin Q3, we ended up reaching contribution profit positive in financial services, which is going to continue to improve in the coming quarters.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nwe are nearing a growth inflection point in our tech platform segment and demand for our combined product suite from large attractive players is the highest that we\'ve ever seen.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nour cross buy rates remain really strong even as we grow our member base. And at higher scale, the benefits of our financial services productivity loop are becoming much more significant.\\r  \\n\\r  \\n**11. what AI strategies or products are you implementing or developing at SoFi?**\\r  \\n\\r  \\nCEO: Konecta being one in our payment risk platform\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI think AI can have the most profound impact on outside of fronted risk is the experience in digital.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI think artificial intelligence will help us do what we\'re focused on every day. We want to answer three questions every day. What must you do in your financial life, what should you do and what can you do?\\r  \\n\\r  \\nWhen you go to your SoFi home feed, we can answer those three questions for you.

Artificial intelligence is a key element that will allow us to accelerate our ability to do so. We\'re using machine learning there today to personalize it for you\\r  \\n\\r  \\n**Closing Remarks:**\\r  \\n\\r  \\nCEO: Before we close, I do want to take one moment to emphasize how much we appreciate the engagement and informed perspectives you all show in regard to SoFi and the future of our business as retail shareholders. We know many of you probably have fulltime jobs, families or other commitments, but taking time to learn and engage with SoFi and any other companies you invest in is the best way to make informed decisions and get your money right.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nTo the Twitter universe, I read all your tweets you may work harder every day.
